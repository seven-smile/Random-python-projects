# Random-python-projects
this repository contain ramdom basic python projects.

1. madlib => this project is to simulate the actions of the madlibs here a 		passage
	is written wih blanks and someone either completes them or read them 
	out by filling in the blanks with thier own words to make a

	low to better skew the guess on the right path.
	
3. guessing game (user generated secret number) => this runs on the same 		principle
	as guessing game (computer generated secret number) except that with this,
	the secret number is chosen by the user and the computer has to 
	guess what number it is, from a range of numbers.
